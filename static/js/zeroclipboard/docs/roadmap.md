# Roadmap

These are things that we have expressed interest in, but haven't implemented yet. There is no order, if you feel like you can complete one of the tasks. Feel free to fork the project and send a pull request with the new code.

<dl>

  <dt>rich clipboard</dt>
  <dd>The flash clipboard api supports RichText Data, and HTML Data. We want to enable that.</dd>

  <dt>actionscript tests</dt>
  <dd>We want to setup a unit test suite for the flash file.</dd>

  <dt>HTML5 Clipboard API</dt>
  <dd>In a perfect world we wouldn't need ZeroClipboard, and the browsers would just take care of it. I would like to write ZeroClipboard to use the browser clipboard api when available.</dd>
